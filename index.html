	<h1>Dr. Thomas Lodi</h1>
	<p>
	Our mission is to keep the light of truth focused on cancer and cancer treatment. This can only be accomplished by continual review and discussions of relevant, peer reviewed, scholarly research regarding the nature of cancer as well as any and all therapeutic modalities from all disciplines to restore health. The restoration of health, by definition is accompanied by the elimination of, not only cancer but all conditions of ill health, classified as “diseases”.

	In order for these efforts to have a practical impact, we will be offering educational and training courses for different levels of students, including: 1) People who want to ‘stop making cancer’. 2) People who want to support those who are actively working to be restored to health. 3) Health care practitioners at all levels of training including, but not limited to medical doctors, naturopathic medical doctors, nurse practitioners, health educators and nutritionists.
